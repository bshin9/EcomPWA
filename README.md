# PROGRESSIVE WEB APP

I add another depth to my e-commerce application by creating an mobile app that the user can download on their phone. This will allow the user to use this app offline. I have also taken the effort to ensure that accessibility, performance, best practices, and SEO are able to hold up for the PWA to work.
